# TODO
# [*] make_sql_cache_table.py
# [ ] sql_cache.cache decorator to cache the ouput a function
# [ ] what about compression?
# [ ] get_multi and set_multi in one SQL query.
# [ ] per facet cache with sql_cache.get_many(*keys) for still one sql query
# [ ] value should probably be a blob

# NOTE:
# We had to use pickle + base64 see http://bugs.python.org/issue2980 
# This table could get very large, very quickly, we should instead have a max KB.
